Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a significant area of research in the field of affective
computing. It involves the identification and classification of emotions from speech signals. In this
project, we develop a software application for SER using machine learning techniques. The software
is designed to recognize various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust,
and neutrality from audio inputs in the form of WAV files. The project utilizes the TESS (Toronto
emotional speech set) dataset for training and evaluation. We employ data preprocessing
techniques, feature extraction methods, and machine learning models, particularly LSTM (Long
Short-Term Memory) neural networks, to accomplish the task. The performance of the developed
model is evaluated in terms of accuracy and loss on a separate test dataset. The software provides a
user-friendly interface for uploading audio files and displaying predicted emotions, along with a
history of predictions. Through this project, we aim to contribute to the advancement of emotion
recognition technology and provide a practical tool for various applications such as human-computer
interaction, mental health monitoring, and sentiment analysis
